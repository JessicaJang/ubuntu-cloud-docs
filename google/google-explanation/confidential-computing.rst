Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX)
-------------------------------------------

Intel introduced Intel® TDX to its confidential computing portfolio with the launch of its new 4th Gen Xeon enterprise processors in January, 2023. Intel® TDX is a combination of hardware and software features that provide isolation and security for virtual machines (VMs) running on Intel processors. It introduces architectural innovations to enable the deployment of hardware-isolated VMs, known as trust domains (TDs). The primary objective of Intel® TDX is to create a robust isolation layer between TDs and the virtual-machine manager (VMM)/hypervisor, as well as other non-TD software. This offers comprehensive protection against a wide spectrum of potential threats. 

These hardware-isolated TDs encompass several critical components, including the Secure Arbitration Mode (SEAM) module, an Intel-provided, digitally-signed security-services module. Additional features of TDX include:

* shared bit in the guest-physical address
* secure extended-page table for address-translation integrity
* physical-address-metadata table for page management
* multi-key total-memory-encryption engine for memory encryption and integrity
* remote attestation 

These features are integral to ensuring the security and trustworthiness of TD execution within the Intel® TDX system. For further details, check out this white paper on `Intel® Trust Domain Extensions`_.

In essence, Intel® TDX empowers you to execute your workloads within a logically isolated hardware-based execution environment. This is achieved by allocating a dedicated segment of system memory that undergoes real-time encryption using an advanced AES-128 encryption engine. TDX also introduces stringent access control measures that govern memory access. This prevents external access, including access from the cloud's privileged system software.


AMD SEV-SNP
-----------

Secure Encrypted Virtualisation-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP) is a security feature available on AMD's EPYC processors. It provides the following benefits for your VMs: 

* `Improved security` - it encrypts the memory pages that contain firmware code. This makes it much more difficult for attackers to gain access to the firmware and launch attacks.
* `Increased isolation` - it allows each VM to have its own secure memory space. This means that a VM cannot access the memory of another VM, even if the hypervisor is compromised.
* `Enhanced performance` - it can be used to improve the performance of virtualised applications. This is because SEV-SNP allows the hypervisor to offload some of the security processing to the processor.

SEV-SNP provides an extra layer of safeguard against malicious hypervisor-based attacks, such as data reply and memory re-mapping, by establishing a secure and isolated execution environment.

It also introduces several optional security enhancements, strengthens protection around interrupt behaviour and bolsters defences against side channel attacks.
