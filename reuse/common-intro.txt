.. Introduction to clouds

Start: Product need and user

**The images create a stable and secure cloud platform** that is ideal for scaling development work
done on Ubuntu-based systems. Since Ubuntu is one of the most favored operating systems among
developers, using an Ubuntu-based image for the corresponding cloud deployment becomes the simplest
option.

**Everyone from individual developers to large enterprises use these images** for developing and deploying
their softwares. For highly regulated industries from the government, medical and finance sectors, 
various security-certified images are also available.

Start: Confidential computing

Confidential computing addresses the question of trust between cloud providers and their users. The idea is to hide and protect sensitive workloads. Users should be allowed to run programs on untrusted systems with the technical assurance that the cloud provider cannot read nor modify the program's data and memory. While it might not be entirely possible to satisfy these requirements, the solutions at least ensure that modification of data is detected.

Data can be thought of as being in one of three states:  

* in-transit - being transmitted from one location to another
* at-rest - stored somewhere and
* in-use - being used by a CPU to perform some operation
  
Both data in-transit and data at-rest can be encrypted using well-known techniques, but securing data in-use needs confidential computing.

Confidential computing is the protection of data in-use by performing computation in a hardware-based trusted execution environment. These are secure and isolated environments that prevent unauthorized access or modification of applications and data while they are in use. In effect, they allow the encryption of data while it is in the system memory. This requires the support of both hardware and the OS. For example, your hardware could be based on Intel's TDX (Trust Domain Extensions) processors or AMD's SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) architecture and the OS could be Ubuntu.

Start: Daily vs release images

Our image retention policy depends on the type of Ubuntu image, we publish two types:

* *release* images - fully tested, production grade images that benefit from Canonical's in-life support
* *daily* images - untested builds that contain all the latest updates from the Ubuntu archive

End: Daily vs release images
