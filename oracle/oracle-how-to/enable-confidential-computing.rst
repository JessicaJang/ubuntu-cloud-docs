Enable Confidential Computing
=============================

Ubuntu images on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure support Confidential Computing on AMD EPYCâ„¢ processors. On `OCI E3 and E4 shapes`_ you have access to the AMD Confidential Computing technology SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization). SEV isolates VM guests from the hypervisor through encrypted memory with a key per VM. See `AMD documentation`_ for more information.

.. _prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

You'll need

- a compartment to create the instance in  

- (optional) a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) to create the instance in. If you don't have one already, you can create a new VCN when you create the instance  

- use a region that supports OCI Confidential Computing (see `Oracle CC documentation`_)


Create an instance with Confidential Computing
----------------------------------------------

While creating a new instance using :guilabel:`Compute` > :guilabel:`Instances` > :guilabel:`Create instance`, under *Image and shape* select :guilabel:`Change image` > :guilabel:`Ubuntu`. Then choose the desired Ubuntu release and image build that is marked to support :guilabel:`Security` feature :guilabel:`Confidential computing`.

Example Ubuntu 24.04 images that support Confidential Computing:

.. image:: enable-confidential-computing/1_ubuntu_images.png

Additionally, under *Image and shape*, select :guilabel:`Change shape` and select a shape that is marked to support :guilabel:`Security` feature :guilabel:`Confidential computing`. If there are no shapes listed that support :guilabel:`Confidential computing`, verify the region selected has support for Confidential Computing (see :ref:`Prerequisites`).

Example :guilabel:`VM.Standard.E4.Flex` shape that supports Confidential Computing in the :guilabel:`US West (Phoenix)` region:

.. image:: enable-confidential-computing/2_confidential_shapes.png

Finally, under *Security* enable :guilabel:`Confidential computing`.
