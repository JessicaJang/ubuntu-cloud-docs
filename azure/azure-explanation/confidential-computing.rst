Security features on Azure
==========================

Azure provides two types of security features:

* `Trusted Launch`_ which is a set of features including virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) and `secure boot`_
* `Confidential Virtual Machine`_ with support for `AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualisation-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP)`_, along with `measured boot`_ using a vTPM

To launch Ubuntu images with Trusted Launch and Confidential VM, refer to :doc:`../azure-how-to/instances/launch-ubuntu-images`.

Trusted launch
--------------

All Ubuntu images from 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) support trusted launch and secure boot on Hyper-V Gen2 instances. 

Confidential VM
---------------

What are confidential VMs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check out our `technical blog post about Confidential VMs on Azure`_.

In short, a confidential VM is a combination of two features:

* *Memory encryption:* The virtual machine's memory is encrypted and decrypted on the fly by the CPU. This is done using AMD SEV-SNP technology. This ensures that the host machine cannot read the memory of the guest since the encryption is done at the hardware level
* *vTPM backed full-disk encryption (FDE):* The file system of the guest OS is encrypted at rest and the key is stored in an enclave. The key cannot be retrieved unless the boot process has stayed untouched since the last sealing of the key. Re-sealing happens when a new kernel is installed as replacing the kernel binary changes the boot sequence. The vTPM is part of the guest VM and its address space. So it benefits from the same run-time security guarantees as the guest VM memory.

It's important to note that memory encryption is always enabled with a confidential VM, but FDE is optional and requires explicit activation after the VM is provisioned.

Using Ubuntu on confidential VMs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently there are two Ubuntu images which support Confidential VMs:

* Ubuntu CVM 20.04 LTS, which supports SEV-SNP
* Ubuntu CVM 22.04 LTS, which supports SEV-SNP - as well as Intel TDX which is still in Public Preview and has yet to reach General Availability.
