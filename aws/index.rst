Ubuntu on AWS
=============


**Ubuntu on AWS is a set of customised Ubuntu images** that allow easy access to a wide range 
of products and services - offered by both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Canonical. These images 
have an optimised kernel that boots faster, has a smaller footprint and includes AWS-specific drivers.

**These images provide a foundation for deploying cloud-based software solutions,** specifically
for software built on Ubuntu and running on AWS. They focus on providing the optimal tools 
and features needed to run specific workloads.
